			Greetings, child. You may not realize this yet, but you
			are very important to me& and to all Elysea. So I will do
			my best to help you as you travel these lands. Make
			your way to Akarios Village. You will find a Bind Point
			there. And take this with you& it is a gift of sorts for
			your journey. May Ariel's light protect you...and
			illuminate your past.
